Building an ***Ensemble Helper*** to be used in programming exercises.

**The Google Chrome extension should be able to:**

1.) Take the names of people who are in the breakout room in Google meet

2.) Assign a random role to each person (3 roles available, navigator, co-navigator, typist)

3.) Have a timer function to start the ensemble (10 or 15 minutes)

4.) After the ensemble time is over, the roles should be swapped 

5.) The roles should be shown on the screen, each person should clearly know their role

Used [this](https://github.com/yfm-po/PomodoroTimer-chromeExtension) repo as a starting point.
