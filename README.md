# Ensemble Helper
Building an Ensemble Helper to be used in programming exercises.

The extension should be able to:
1.) Take the names of people who are in the breakout room in Google meet
2.) Assign a random role to each person (3 roles available, navigator, co-navigator, typist)
3.) Have a timer function to start the ensemble (10 or 15 minutes)
4.) After the ensemble time is over, the roles should be swapped 
5.) The roles should be shown on the screen, each person should clearly know their role

Used https://github.com/yfm-po/PomodoroTimer-chromeExtension as boilerplate.
